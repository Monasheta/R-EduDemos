Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for stopping by this page. Let's embark on a journey together. ðŸš€ðŸŒŸ


### [Brushstrokes of My Journey (BOMJ) ðŸŽ¨âœ¨](BOMJ.jpeg)** 
 
**Introduction**

In the quiet of the library, where pages turned softly, my research journey began. Initially, my goal was to simplify complex topics and sometimes teach others. But soon, it turned into a real passion for the cool wonders that research holds, shaping a special story about who I am now.

**Professional Aspirations**

Teaching always fascinated me. It felt like making the world simple for curious minds, like unlocking book secrets or figuring out the universe's puzzles. Going deeper, I got interested in living things. In this world, cells, the small builders of life's wonders, hold the key to understanding everything. Studying them helps us know how life works. Without realizing it, I moved from making things simple to a big mission â€“ understanding secrets hidden in cells.

**Passion for Cancer Research**

My journey into cancer research started in junior high when my dad had Breast Cancer. Despite treatment, he passed away, and it was hard. This sparked my early interest in understanding cells, turning it into a mission to uncover cancer cell mysteries and find their Achilles' heel. Hence, the lab became my safe place, and studying cancer cells became personal. Every experiment was a step toward understanding cancer cells more, inspired by my dad's struggle and the wish to help others avoid similar pain.

**Research Philosophy**

My research journey is more than finding answers; it's about gaining knowledge to help others. As I go on, I also find joy in the classroom, where I'm not just a researcher but also a storyteller, revealing the story written in the graceful dance of cancer cells under the microscope. Sharing insights about the mysteries of these cells with eager minds means more to me as I connect research and education seamlessly.

**Connect with Curiosity**

So, from the quiet library to the lab and classroom, my story unfolded â€“ a tale of love for research, a journey from simplicity to a deeper mission, all connected by the thread of curiosity and a desire to make the wonders accessible to all.
